<h4 class="subsequentNewsItem">6/21/2011 - Hudson 2.1.0 Beta 1 Available</h4>
 <p>Concurrent with the work to tidy Hudson up in preparation for Eclipse we've been able to devote some time to providing a beta version of the eagerly awaited 2.1.0 release which importantly introduces support for Maven 3 and GIT into core.</p>
 <p>At the moment the beta is available only as a WAR file. If you need a production quality release the 2.0.1 distribution is available. This beta is for evaluation only and could possible cause problems with . If you are running production Hudson instances wait for the official 2.1.0 production release.</p>
 <p>There are a few known issues with this release&quot;</p>
 <ul>
   <li><a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-8914" target="_blank">HUDSON-8914</a> - GWT UI On the Maven 3 configuration page not showing on IE9 </li>

   <li>There is also a problem with some dual Hudson / Jenkins plugins where the addition of a new Jenkins API (org.jenkinsci.plugins.tokenmacro.DataBoundTokenMacro ) may cause ClassNotFoundExceptions</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Concurrently with this new release we encourage you to take a look at the ongoing <strong>Hudson Book</strong> project. This <a href="http://hudson-ci.org/hudson/job/hudson-book/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/hudson-pdf/target/hudson-complete.pdf">complete guide to Hudson</a> can be downloaded from the Hudson-ci site and it's free!

<h4 class="subsequentNewsItem">4/21/2011 - Hudson 2.0.0 Is released</h4>
 <p>We're pleased to announce the general availability of Hudson 2.0.0. As well as marking the start of a new numbering scheme, this release addresses 29 bug fixes and enhancements, many of which were voted for by the community. 
 <p>
 <p>The key features to note are:<ul>
 <li>Improvements to the JSR 330 Injection mechanism including the option to disable it for extreme compatibility</li>
 <li>Dialog based user action confirmation introduced</li>
 <li>Plugin/extension handling improvement</li>
 <li>Option to clean workspace before build</li>
 <li>Improvements in maven project build runtime </li></ul></p>

 <a name="versioning"></a><h4 class="subsequentNewsItem">3/30/2011 - Revision of Hudson Versioning Scheme</h4>
 <p>Discussion has been flowing on the Dev lists with respect to the current versioning scheme. The current proposal is that the scheme will change from the current two part n.nnn scheme to a more granular 3 part scheme where: <ol><li>The first digit is changed in response to a change involving major architectural change or feature addition.</li>
 <li>The second digit is changed in response to minor enhancements which do not break compatibility</li>
 <li>The final digit is changed in response to bug fixes and patches which likewise do not effect compatibility</li></ol></p><p>In order to switch to this new scheme the proposal is that the numbering will reset to 2.0.0 with the next regular release. This way the scheme can be introduced without messing up the update center.</p>	
<a name="1.398"></a><h4 class="subsequentNewsItem">3/14/2011 - Hudson 1.398 Is released</h4>
 <p>We're pleased to announce the availability of Hudson 1.398. This release introduces streamlining of the plugin development and release process as explained <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Releasing+Hudson+Plugin">here in the Hudson wiki</a>. Additionally more infrastructure cleanup has been done and bugs are fixed in the Emma and Perforce plugins amongst others. For more information check out the <a href="../changelog.html">changelog</a>.</p>	
 <a name="processDocs"></a><h4 class="subsequentNewsItem">2/20/2011 - New Process Documents Published</h4>
 <p>To help with the future governance of Hudson as a strong and open community based project, we've defined some process documents that clearly outline the release and development process and the responsibilities of committers. These documents are also linked from the <a href="index.html">main documents</a> page under "Process Documents":</p>
 <ul>
        <li><a href="hudson_software_process.html">Software Process - Duties for Committers</a></li>
        <li><a href="hudson_release_process.html">Release and Development Processes for Hudson Core</a></li>

<a name="1.396"></a><h4 class="subsequentNewsItem">2/10/2011 - Hudson 1.396 Is released</h4>
 <p>We're pleased to announce the availability of Hudson 1.396. The main purpose of this release was to correct the Update center used by Hudson to it's real home at the Hudson project. We did however, take the opportunity to do a full set of multi-platform regression and integration tests on the bits before release. As we move forward there will be more and more of this kind of testing baked into the release process so you can be confident about the quality of the code that is published.</p>
 <a name="future"></a><h4 class="subsequentNewsItem">1/30/2011 - The Future of Hudson</h4>
<p>Many of you may be aware that Andrew Bayer and Cloudbees (where Kohsuke Kawaguchi now works) have confirmed their intent to fork  Hudson into a new community.  We want the Hudson community to know that we have a dedicated team that includes people from Oracle, as well as some of our partners and current Hudson community members who will continue to build and grow the Hudson project and community.  Your current installations will continue to run fine, and you won't need to change any code.  You can still come to <em><strong>http://www.hudson-ci.org/</strong></em> for all things Hudson.</p>
<p>As part of the fork, the current Hudson mailing list on google groups are being taken away.  We will go back to using the <a href="http://java.net/projects/hudson/lists">Hudson mailing list on java.net</a> that we were using up until early December.  We will announce when that takes effect, sometime early this week.  Also as part of the fork, the Hudson github project is being taken away.  We have a mirror of the Hudson github repository (in git) on <a href="http://java.net/projects/hudson/sources">hudson.java.net</a> where people can continue to check things in.  We can discuss moving this back to github once we get things settled. </p>
<p>Our primary goals over the next months will be to fix high-priority bugs in the current edition of Hudson and formalize a development and release process that will allow users of Hudson to have more insight into what is being changed, why it is being changed, and when their bugs will be fixed.  We will also continue the discussion that I started last month about what the next version of Hudson (v2) looks like.  I look forward to working closely with the community on where to go from here.<br>

 <a name="maillists"></a><h4 class="subsequentNewsItem">1/30/2011 - Mailing Lists and Forums</h4>
<p>The Hudson mailing lists and new forums are available on <a href="http://java.net/projects/hudson">java.net</a>. These replace the google-groups that were temporarily adopted due to problems with the old java.net infrastructure</p>
